# math_drawing
With this program you'll be able to make images with self drawn rectangles and/or squares. When you run the file named 'main.py', the program'll ask for x- and y-coordinates, width and height of the canvas and of the shape you want to draw. You can draw as many rectangles and squares as you want. When you're done drawing, you can type 'quit' and the program will make a PNG file of your drawing and save it in the same directory as where the program is placed. This program is part of my OOP (Object-Oriented-Programming) training.
