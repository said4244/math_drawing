Description: An app that lets the user provide the start coordinates 
of a geometrical shape (either square or rectangle), their dimensions
and their color. Then the program generates an image file canvas with
the shapes drawn on it.

nouns = app, shape(square rectangle), image, canvas

objects = square rectangle canvas
